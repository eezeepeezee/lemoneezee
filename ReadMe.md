Yet another frontend-template. Or framework. Or boilerplate. Whatever.

## What is LemonEezee?

LemonEezee is a fully configurable and not overstyled frontend-template that helps quickly start projects from scratch. It provides a wide range of tasks to automate the web-developing process and has some nice functions inside to make this process more precise.

## Installation and basic usage

Get the repo onto your local machine (or download zip):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eezeepeezee/lemoneezee.git my-awesome-project
```

Install npm packages:

```bash
cd my-awesome-project
npm i
```

Start working:

```bash
gulp runapp
```

While it is still alpha, full manual will be published later.

## Who may need this?

Mostly, individual developers and small teams who don't want to waste time for organizing workflow instead of doing work itself.

## What are the key ideas of LemonEezee?

1. **Lots of predefined markup and styles, but the design is up to you.** LemonEezee will help you with grids, colors, spacers, and typography, it contains a lot of code snippets and next releases will provide configurable and flexible component templates. But at the end of the day, you will have to care about how to use these grids, colors, spacers, and other stuff properly and how it needs to be used according to your design.
2. **Change anything you want in its core, but the core is already well-configured.** There are a lot of automated tasks for compiling templates, styles, and scripts with some tricky things like custom separating and bundling, and so on. It provides logic for file structure — but it is easy to hold it the way you want.
3. **Get some nice help!** With Layout Helpers module you will get some nice stuff like visualizing guides and breakpoints, "mouse killer" to test your UI in keyboard-only, and a couple more cool things.

## Skills requirements

- **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **Sass**, **Vanilla JS**, a little bit of **Twig**.
- Know how to run commands in terminal and be familiar with **Node.js** and **NPM** (if you are not aware of any of those — it is worth spending couple hours on YouTube and you're one level up).
